# vision_based_transfomer_architectures

The project plans to analyze various transformer models using vision-based approaches
with two distinct methodologies. The first methodology is training from scratch, the
second method is fine-tuning the models with chosen dataset.
Chosen dataset is Butterfly & Months Image Classification 100 species from Kaggle.[1] The dataset
contains 12594 trains, 500 tests, and 500 validation images. Each imageâ€™s size is 224 x 224.
There are 100 different classes in the dataset.
Determined models to analyze:
1. ViT(Vision-based Transformer)
2. Compact Transformers
3. Swin Transformers
4. Data-efficient Image Transformers(DeIT)
